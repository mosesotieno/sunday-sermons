    "text": "Choice of the time if the day makes the day binding. Talk to God about the day you have chosen to pray and fast. God does not want us to fast by default. It must be intentional.\nAsk Him for grace for fasting. Submit to God and receive the grace.\nAs Him for the strength to fast. Trust Him to help you concentrate on fasting.\nYou choice influences such. Without the choice, you cant reach the desired point.\nIt brings to it seriousness in your mind.\nThe day you fast is the day acceptable to the Lord.\nFasting is a righteous act. Some regular things should be.\nLimit regular activities so you may concentrate on the fasting.\nThe goal of fasting is to be intimate with God. A time be heard on high. When you fast you seek to be heard high\nup there. We fast to increase our chances to be heard.\nEffective fasting depends on your lifestyle.\nThere is how we must live before we fast. Our effectivity in fasting largely depends on how we live.\nThe foundation of fasting is our lifestyle.\nIf we live carelessly and begin to fast we just give basis for satan.\nBefore we fast lets live to honour to God. God will not listen to us when we pray but ignore social justice"
